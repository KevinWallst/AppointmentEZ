// Debugging Tips:
// - Open the browser console (F12) to see detailed logs
// - Look for logs with colored backgrounds, which contain important debugging information
// - Check for any error messages in the console
// - Verify that the __modalCloseInProgress flag is set to true when closing the modal
// - Verify that the flag is cleared after the modal is closed

// If the error still occurs:
// 1. Check if the CSV file is corrupted (should be clean with proper line endings)
// 2. Verify that all API endpoints are using the same CSV file path
// 3. Check for any race conditions in the code
// 4. Look for any fetch requests being made after the modal close flag is set
